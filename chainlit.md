# Welcome to UC Online Copilot
UC Online Copilot is designed to help students in finding relevant course contents (lessons and videos in Rise Articulate platform) with respect to the course they are currently enrolled in. The Sustainability Systems in Engineering course is used as a case study to demonstrate the capabilities of this tool. Please note that currently supports only single-turn conversations, meaning each question is treated independently without considering previous questions and answers.

This project is created by Timotius Marselo as part of the DATA429-24SU2 course (supervised by Paul Bostock).
